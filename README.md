🔩 Torsion Testing Machine Project
This project focuses on analyzing the torsional behavior of mechanical components under applied torque. It includes calculations, visualizations, and insights into material properties like shear stress, angle of twist, and modulus of rigidity.

📌 Objective
To experimentally and analytically study the torsion of circular shafts and verify theoretical relationships between torque, shear stress, and angle of twist.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)
Jupyter Notebook / Colab
Excel (for data collection and initial analysis)
Mechanical Lab setup for torsion testing

📊 Features
Data collection from torsion testing machine
Shear stress vs. angle of twist plotting
Calculation of:
Polar moment of inertia

📝 Methodology
Collected torque and angle of twist data from lab experiments.
Used theoretical formulas:
τ = T*r / J
φ = TL / (JG)
